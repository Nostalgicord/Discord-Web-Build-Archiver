Archive Discord web builds by only using the build's index.html file, using Python and Regex.

## Roadmap
1. Speed up download assets.
2. Decrease false positive regex matches.

## How to use
1. Install libraries from `requirements.txt`
2. Run `main.py` 
3. Insert you Discord web build's index.html inside `project root/build`
4. Insert the number of times to download assets. (Sometimes the JS files downloads other JS files which include other assets, this just maximize the files range.)
5. Sit back for 2-5 hours and that's it!
